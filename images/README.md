# Extension Icons

You need to create icon files in the following sizes:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

These icons should reflect your Brainly brand and should be in PNG format with transparency.

You can use design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, or online tools like Canva to create these icons.

## Guidelines for Icons

1. Use a simple, recognizable design that works at small sizes
2. Ensure the icon is recognizable even at 16x16 pixels
3. Use your brand colors for consistency
4. Include some visual element that suggests "saving" or "bookmarking"
5. Test how the icon looks in both light and dark browser themes

Remember that these icons will represent your extension in the Chrome Web Store and in users' browser toolbars, so they should be professionally designed and visually appealing.
